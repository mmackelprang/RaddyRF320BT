# Raddy RF320 Bluetooth Protocol

This project contains a comprehensive implementation and documentation of a Bluetooth protocol for controlling the Raddy RF320 device. The project includes both the original Java reverse-engineered code, some bluetooth packet captures and a modern C# implementation with enhanced features.

## üéØ Quick Start

### App / Protocol Analysis
- The original app was decompiled with apktool
- Found the the bluetooth specific portion of the app in ```smali\com\myhomesmartlife\bluetooth```
- Pointing an LLM (Claude Sonnet) at it, asking it to generate a more readable version of the code (the original app was obfuscated before publishing)
- Claude generated the initial cut at the reverse engineered java files in JavaExtracted.
- Ran the Radio-C app on my Android phone with bluetooth packet capture turned on, and generated a few bug reports.
- Looked at the packet captures in WireShark and generated an XML version of this data to feed into the LLM (see docs/BTDump.pdml).
- Created a simple bluetooth app to connect to the RF320 and capture packets being sent (see docs/Messages From RF320.txt)
- Asked Claude to use the data from the packet dumps to try to flesh out the protocol definition further.
- Generated a modern c# version of this protocol to use to hit the actual hardware and debug further.

This is all motivated by a desire for me to refurb a 1940's console radio by Grandpa Anderson gave me when he died.  It had AM/FM/SW on it and I used to love playing with it trying to find interesting stations.  Normally this would be a time station with UTC beeping on it.  I'd like for my grandkids to have a similar experience with SW radio, but plan to incorporate Spotify, Google Cast, vinyl records etc. into the device.  

Note that I've asked Raddy for 'real' specs on their Bluetooth protocol, but haven't heard whether they're willing to share them.  If they do and don't mind if I share with others, I'll post here.

## Implementation Notes

### Connection Sequence
1. Scan for BLE devices
2. Connect to radio device via GATT
3. Discover services and characteristics
4. Find write characteristic (ff13) and notify characteristic (ff14)
5. Enable notifications on ff14
6. Send handshake command (CMD_HANDSHAKE)
7. Wait for ready state

### Data Flow
```
App ‚Üí RadioCommandSender ‚Üí RadioBluetoothManager ‚Üí BLE GATT ‚Üí Radio Device
App ‚Üê RadioProtocolHandler ‚Üê RadioBluetoothManager ‚Üê BLE GATT ‚Üê Radio Device
```

### Error Handling
- Check `isReady()` before sending commands
- Monitor connection state via `ConnectionListener`
- Parse received data via `DataReceivedListener`

### Haptic Feedback
The command sender provides optional vibration feedback (100ms) on each button press, mimicking physical button tactile response.

## Additional Resources

### Reverse Engineering Notes
The original app was decompiled to smali bytecode. Key findings:
- Main communication logic in `MainActivity.smali` and `MainActivity$162.smali`
- Command definitions in `SendData.smali`
- Data parsing in `MainActivity.a([B)` method

### Protocol Observations
- All commands use 5-byte packets (except handshake which uses 4 bytes)
- Command type 0x0C is used for all button presses
- Checksum is simple additive checksum modulo 256
- Received packets use different format with variable length
- Frequency is transmitted in hexadecimal and converted to decimal Hz

## License & Usage

These classes are provided for educational and interoperability purposes. They document the reverse-engineered protocol of the radio device for development of compatible applications.

**Note:** This is a cleaned-up version of decompiled obfuscated code. Some functionality may need testing and validation with actual hardware.

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add checksum verification for received packets
- Implement frequency encoding/decoding helpers
- Add support for additional packet types
- Create unit tests for protocol encoding/decoding
- Add async command queuing for reliable transmission
- Implement retry logic for failed commands
