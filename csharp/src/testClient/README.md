- **Band Switching**: Cycles through all bands (AIR/WB/FM/VHF/MW/SW)
- **Volume Control**: VolAdd/VolDel update radio volume in real-time
- **Frequency Entry**: Number keys + Point + FreqConfirm accepted by radio
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time updates for volume, modulation mode, band, signal strength, and frequency
- **BLE Connection**: Stable connection using Service ff12, Characteristics ff13 (TX) and ff14 (RX)
- **Band Name Display**: ✅ FULLY DECODED - FM/MW/SW/AIR/WB/VHF from byte 3 of ab0901 messages
- **Signal Strength**: ✅ FULLY DECODED - 0-6 signal bars from high nibble of byte 9 (ab0901)
- **Frequency Display**: ✅ FULLY DECODED - Nibble-based extraction from bytes 4-7 with band-specific decimal places
  - MW/AM: 0 decimal places (e.g., 1270 KHz)
  - FM: 2 decimal places (e.g., 102.30 MHz)
  - All others: 3 decimal places (e.g., 119.345 MHz)
  - Unit indicator from byte 8 (0=MHz, 1=KHz)

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented

Log files are stored in: `%LocalAppData%\RadioClient\Logs\RadioClient_YYYYMMDD_HHmmss.log`

## Project Structure

### Core Protocol Files
- **`IRadioTransport.cs`** - Abstraction layer for BLE I/O operations
- **`RadioProtocol.cs`** - Frame and state parsing logic with protocol definitions
- **`RadioBT.cs`** - High-level radio session manager with event handling
- **`FrameFactory.cs`** - Helper methods for building protocol frames

### Application Files
- **`Program.cs`** - Main console application with BLE scanning and keyboard handling
- **`WinBleTransport.cs`** - Windows BLE implementation of IRadioTransport
- **`MessageLogger.cs`** - Thread-safe logging system for all radio communications
- **`KeyboardMapper.cs`** - Keyboard-to-CanonicalAction mapping with help display

### Configuration
- **`RadioClient.csproj`** - .NET 8.0 Windows project targeting Windows 10.0.19041.0

## Building and Running

### Requirements
- **Windows 10** version 1809 (build 17763) or later
- **.NET 8.0 SDK** or later
- **Bluetooth LE** support (built-in or USB adapter)

### Build
```powershell
Set-Location c:\prj\RaddyRF320BT\csharp\src\testClient
dotnet build
```

### Run

**Interactive Mode** (keyboard control):
```powershell
dotnet run
```

**Command-Line Mode** (automated testing):
```powershell
dotnet run -- <action1> <action2> ...
```

Or after building:
```powershell
.\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0\win-x64\RadioClient.exe
```

## Using the Test Application

### Mode Selection

The application supports two operating modes:

#### 1. Interactive Mode (default)
Run without arguments to start keyboard control:
```powershell
dotnet run
```

1. Ensure your RF320 radio is powered on and advertising
2. Run the application - it will automatically scan for devices
3. When an RF320 device is found, the app will connect automatically
4. After successful connection and handshake, the keyboard interface activates

#### 2. Command-Line Mode (automated)
Pass command names as arguments to send them automatically:
```powershell
# Test band change
dotnet run -- Band

# Test volume control
dotnet run -- VolAdd VolAdd VolDel

# Test frequency entry (123.45 MHz)
dotnet run -- Number1 Number2 Number3 Point Number4 Number5 FreqConfirm
```

**Command-Line Mode Behavior:**
- Connects to device automatically
- Sends all specified commands with 100ms spacing
- Waits 5 seconds for responses
- Exits automatically
- All messages logged to file

**Available Command Names:**
Use the CanonicalAction enum names (case-sensitive):
- Numbers: `Number0` through `Number9`
- Volume: `VolAdd`, `VolDel`
- Navigation: `FreqUp`, `FreqDown`, `FreqUpHold`, `FreqDownHold`
- Functions: `Band`, `Power`, `FreqConfirm`, `Point`, `Back`
- Extended: `SubBand`, `Music`, `Play`, `PlayHold`, `Step`, `Circle`, etc.

**Example Test Sessions:**
```powershell
# Quick band test
dotnet run -- Band

# Volume control test
dotnet run -- VolAdd VolAdd VolAdd VolDel VolDel

# Frequency entry: 146.52 MHz
dotnet run -- Number1 Number4 Number6 Point Number5 Number2 FreqConfirm

# Multiple function test
dotnet run -- Power Band VolAdd FreqUp
```

All test results are saved to log files in `%LocalAppData%\RadioClient\Logs\`

### Keyboard Controls

- **Ctrl+.**: Point hold
- **Ctrl+N**: Memo hold

### Screen Output
The application provides real-time feedback:
```
  → TX: D → Demodulation                        (Sent to radio)
  ← RX: Ack: SUCCESS                             (Received from radio)
  ← STATE: Band=VHF    Freq=145.095 MHz  Signal:[████░░] Good
           (decoded from nibbles: 0x236C7)       (Exact frequency decoded!)
  ← VolumeValue: '12'                           (Status update)
```

### Exiting
Press **ESC** to exit. The application will:
1. Close the BLE connection gracefully
2. Display the location of the log file
3. Save all logged data

## Code Usage Examples

### Basic Protocol Usage
```csharp
IRadioTransport transport = /* platform implementation */;
var radio = new RadioBT(transport);

// Initialize with handshake
if (await radio.InitializeAsync())
{
    // Send commands
    await radio.SendAsync(CanonicalAction.Power);
    await radio.SendAsync(CanonicalAction.Number1);
    await radio.SendAsync(CanonicalAction.FreqConfirm);
}

// Monitor state updates
radio.StateUpdated += (_, state) => 
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Frequency: {state.FrequencyMHz:0.00000} MHz");
};

// Monitor frame reception
radio.FrameReceived += (_, frame) =>
{
    if (frame.Group == CommandGroup.Ack && frame.CommandId == 0x01)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Command acknowledged!");
    }
};
```

### Creating Custom Transport
```csharp
public sealed class CustomTransport : IRadioTransport
{
    public event EventHandler<byte[]>? NotificationReceived;
    
    public async Task<bool> WriteAsync(byte[] data)
    {
        // Write to GATT characteristic (UUID: 0000fff2-...)
        // Return true if successful
    }
    
    public void Dispose()
    {
        // Clean up GATT connection
    }
    
    private void OnDataReceived(byte[] data)
    {
        // Call when data received from characteristic (UUID: 0000fff1-...)
        NotificationReceived?.Invoke(this, data);
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Device Found
- Ensure RF320 radio is powered on
- Check that Bluetooth is enabled on your PC
- Verify the device name contains "RF320"
- Try moving closer to the radio

### Connection Failed
- Restart the radio
- Restart Bluetooth on your PC
- Run the application as Administrator if permission errors occur
- Check Windows Bluetooth & devices settings

### Commands Not Working
- Verify handshake completed (look for "Ack: SUCCESS" after "Initializing radio")
- Check the log file for error messages
- Ensure radio is not in a locked or special mode

### Log File Location
If you can't find the log file, it's at:
```
%LocalAppData%\RadioClient\Logs\RadioClient_YYYYMMDD_HHmmss.log
```

## Protocol Details

### Service and Characteristics (✅ Hardware Verified)
- **Vendor Service UUID**: `0000ff12-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- **TX Characteristic** (Write): `0000ff13-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- **RX Characteristic** (Notify): `0000ff14-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`

Additional services:
- **Battery Service**: `0000180f-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` (standard BLE service)
- **Alternative Service**: `0000ff10-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` (purpose unclear)

### Frame Format
```
Standard Command: [AB 02 GG CC XX]
  AB    = Header
  02    = Protocol version
  GG    = Command group (0C=Button, 12=Ack, 1C=Status)
  CC    = Command ID
  XX    = Checksum (Base + CommandID)

Handshake: [AB 01 FF AB]
  Note: Device does NOT send ACK response
  Instead: Device starts streaming status messages (Group 1C)

Status Messages: [AB LEN 1C TYPE DATA...]
  AB    = Header
  LEN   = Length indicator (05 or 06)
  1C    = Status group
  TYPE  = Subtype (06 or 08 observed)
  DATA  = Variable payload
  
  Device continuously streams status (~2-3 msg/sec)
```

## Protocol Reverse Engineering - COMPLETE! 🎉

All critical RF320-BLE protocol features have been successfully decoded:
- ✅ Command transmission (WriteWithResponse required)
- ✅ Band name decoding (6 bands mapped)
- ✅ Signal strength decoding (0-6 bars with quality labels)
- ✅ **Frequency decoding (nibble-based extraction formula)**
- ✅ Volume status monitoring
- ✅ Modulation mode detection

### Remaining Optional Features

1. **Battery Level Monitoring** (Low Priority)
   - BLE Battery Service (UUID 0x180f) is present on device
   - Requires separate GATT read operation
   - Not critical for radio control functionality
   - **Action**: Implement BluetoothGattService query for battery characteristic

2. **Frequency Decoding Formula** ✅ COMPLETE (Nov 13, 2025)
   - **BREAKTHROUGH**: Nibble-based extraction formula discovered!
   - **Algorithm**:
     1. Extract nibbles from Bytes 4-7: B4High, B4Low, B5High, B5Low, B6Low
     2. Assemble hex string: B6Low + B5High + B5Low + B4High + B4Low
     3. Convert to decimal
     4. Apply band-specific decimal places: FM=2, MW=0, Others=3
     5. Check Byte 8: 0=MHz, 1=KHz
   - **Verified** against all 5 hardware test frequencies: 100% accurate!
     - MW:  1.270 MHz → Nibbles: 0,0,4,F,6 → 1270 KHz ✓
     - FM:  102.30 MHz → Nibbles: 0,2,7,F,6 → 10230 ✓
     - AIR: 119.345 MHz → Nibbles: 1,D,2,3,1 → 119345 ✓
     - WB:  162.40 MHz → Nibbles: 2,7,A,6,0 → 162400 ✓
     - VHF: 145.095 MHz → Nibbles: 2,3,6,C,7 → 145095 ✓

3. **Signal Strength Parsing** ✅ COMPLETE
   - ✅ Decoded from Byte 9 high nibble of ab0901 messages
   - ✅ Signal bars: 0-6 (No Signal → Excellent)
   - ✅ Displayed in real-time with visual bar graph
   - Note: Type 0x05/0x07 status messages (SNR/RSSI labels) are informational only

3. **Band Name Detection** ✅ COMPLETE
   - ✅ Decoded from Byte 3 of ab0901 messages
   - ✅ Mapping verified: 0x00=FM, 0x01=MW, 0x02=SW, 0x03=AIR, 0x06=WB, 0x07=VHF
   - Note: Type 0x02 status shows modulation type (AM/NFM/WFM), not band name

### Medium Priority
4. **Additional Status Fields**
   - Type 0x01 (Demodulation), 0x03 (BandWidth), 0x04 (Unknown) send labels only
   - Type 0x0B (Model), 0x0C (Status/EQ) partially decoded
   - Type 0x10 (Recording status) shows "REC OFF" correctly
   - Byte 6-8 values in ab0901 message purpose unclear

5. **Fractional Frequency Correlation**
   - Types 0x06 and 0x08 show decimal portions (e.g., ".345" from "119.345")
   - Not always accurate or synchronized with main frequency
   - May represent secondary receiver or scan frequency

### Low Priority
6. **ab090f Frame Support**
   - Alternate state message format observed in logs
   - Layout differs from ab0901
   - Purpose and decoding unknown

7. **Battery Level**
   - Standard BLE Battery Service (0x180f) present
   - Not accessed by current implementation
   - May require separate GATT read operation

## Future Enhancements
- Implement configuration file for custom key mappings
- Add batch command scripting from files
- Support for multiple simultaneous radio connections
- Enhanced frequency scanning and monitoring modes
- Real-time frequency spectrum display
- Preset/memory channel management

## Contributing
To help decode the remaining status fields:
1. Run the app with `dotnet run` and press ESC after 10-20 seconds
2. Share the log file from `%LocalAppData%\RadioClient\Logs\`
3. Include the actual radio display readings (band, frequency, volume, signal)
4. Note any changes you made during the capture (button presses, frequency changes)
